<h1>CRYPTOMANIA _mvc-formik-yup_</h1>

After the 2024 Bitcoin halving, I wanted to create the Cryptomania application. This application is designed with an MVC architecture. Form requirements are defined using powerful tools like Formik and Yup. Cryptomania fetches the latest cryptocurrency prices from the CoinCap API and presents them.
